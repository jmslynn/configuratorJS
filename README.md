# configuratorJS

This project started as a coding assignment. It uses javascript, bootstrap, and json formatted data sets.

## Design and Development Decisions

The assignment included a page and functionality to copy. I have since modified it to be more generic.

### Future Improvements

I'd like to see how well I can have the design text display on the tumbler image.
